# Node.js PostgreSQL API with Express, TypeORM, and JWT Authentication

This repository contains a Node.js-based API that allows users to interact with a PostgreSQL database. It uses the Express.js framework to create endpoints for CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations and implements user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
